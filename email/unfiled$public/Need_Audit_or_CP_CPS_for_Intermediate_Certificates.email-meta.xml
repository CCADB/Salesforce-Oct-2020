    <textOnly>Dear Certification Authority,

This is a courtesy reminder from Mozilla that audit statements or CP/CPS documents are missing for the following intermediate certificate records in the Common CA Database (CCADB):

{!IntermediateCertificateList}

For each of the certificates listed above, please update their record in the CCADB to provide audit and policy information as described here:

https://ccadb.org/cas/

For new intermediate certificates that will be listed in their parent or root certificate&apos;s next audit statements and CP/CPS, please check the &apos;Audits Same as Parent&apos; and &apos;CP/CPS Same as Parent&apos; boxes in their records in the CCADB. Mozilla&apos;s Root Store Policy says: &quot;If the CA has a currently valid audit report at the time of creation of the certificate, then the new certificate MUST appear on the CA&apos;s next periodic audit reports.

This is an automated email that will be sent regularly until the audit statements and policy documents have been correctly disclosed in the CCADB.

Regards,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
