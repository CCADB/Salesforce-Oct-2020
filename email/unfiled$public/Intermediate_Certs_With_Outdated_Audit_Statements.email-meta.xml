    <textOnly>Dear Certification Authority,

Your CA has &lt;#&gt; intermediate certificate records in the Common CA Database (CCADB) that have outdated audit statements. Please login to the CCADB to provide audit and policy information as described here:

ccadb.org/cas/intermediates

A report of the intermediate certificates that need to be updated may be found by logging into the CCADB, clicking on the &apos;Reports&apos; tab and the &apos;CA Community Reports&apos; folder. The report is called &quot;My Outdated Audit Statements for ICs&quot;

{!IntermediateCertificateList}
(#10#)

This is an automated email that will be sent regularly until the audit statements have been updated in your CA&apos;s intermediate certificate records in the CCADB.

Regards,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
